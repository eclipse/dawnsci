/**
 * This class represents a page in a page book view which
 * is associated with a specific tool in the plotting system. The tool
 * is a 1D tool meaning it is linked to a 1D plot. It itself does
 * not show a 1D plot normally and if it does, no tools menu will be
 * shown. This prevents recursion which it was decided is too complex
 * for users.
 * 
 * The tool this page connects to currently has some limitations which
 * should be adhered to for the over all UI design to be coherent:
 * 
 * 1. Implement getToolRole() to provide information as to where the tool
 *    page should appear. For instance ToolPageRole.ROLE_2D would have a 1D plot
 *    with tool pages available if their type is ToolPageRole.ROLE_1D, normally.
 *    
 * 2. Do not plot things in an IToolPage with a 1D role directly. These are 1D
 * tools and should plot back to the original 1D view if they have 1D data to plot.
 * This avoids recursion.
 * 
 * If you have to plot on a 1D tool, by default the tools menu will not be shown so you cannot
 * do recursive tools. (This can be overridden by implementing getAdpater(...) for
 * IToolPageSystem if you really need to, but you are breaking the rules a little and
 * some things may not work.)
