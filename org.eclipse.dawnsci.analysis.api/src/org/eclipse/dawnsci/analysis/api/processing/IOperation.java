/**
 * Interface to encapsulate processing operations on an IRichDataset
 * The idea of this class is that its data context, the data it is operating
 * on is passed in as an IRichDataset. Then each slice is operated on in the
 * execute method.
 * 
 * For instance background correction, azimuthal integration.
 * 
 * Your operation many be contributed via an extension point from any plugin. 
 * In this case the operation will be instantiated through a no argument constructor
 * so that the operation type can be retrieved. 
 * 
 * When you create an IOperation is must be marked with @Operation so that 
 * it can be read into the operation service.
