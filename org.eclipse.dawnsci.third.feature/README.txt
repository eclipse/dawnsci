This feature is the one which builds the dawnsci_third p2 site.

The dawnsci third p2 site is the minimal set of external dependencies to build dawn.
It should not have things added willy nilly.

Currently the uk.ac.diamond.org.apache.activemq_5.9.0.jar is not needed by dawn.
Therefore it should be migrated away to another p2 site as soon as possible.
